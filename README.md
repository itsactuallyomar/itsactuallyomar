# Omar â€” Just a Tech

**20 years old from Baghdad, Iraq.**  
Self-taught hacker on a mission to break into the field.

No degree. No certifications. Just raw action and proof of real skill.

I donâ€™t study cybersecurity â€” I attack it.

Logging my journey publicly with tools, writeups, and weekly updates.

## âš¡ My Plan

- Build real, practical skills to earn my first job in IT/cybersecurity  
- Break into systems "ethically" to master red team techniques  
- Use Hack The Box and TryHackMe daily  
- Document everything I learn in public repos  
- Build a solid GitHub-based hacking toolkit  
- Share weekly logs, writeups, and tools  
- Report real-world vulnerabilities when discovered

## ðŸ§  Background

I already have experience with the basic stuff like:

- Networking
- Programming with Python, C++, JavaScript
- SQL
- Linux
- Web Development
- Virtual Labs

Today Iâ€™m setting up this GitHub. Next: diving deep into offensive security.
